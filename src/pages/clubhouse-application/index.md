Hi Clubhouse team ðŸ‘‹,

Iâ€™m Arthur, an `iOS Tech Lead at Uber` based in San Francisco. I am really excited about Clubhouse, its future and ðŸ‘‰ would love to join your team ðŸ‘ˆ!

I have learned a ton at Uber and I think itâ€™s time to start my next challenge; one of the reasons is that Uber doesnâ€™t move fast enough! To keep my passion for building products, I do lots of side projects and iOS apps.

Most of them are social: Iâ€™m currently building a Social Trading app (I wrote about it [here](https://lifegorithms.com/sotrade/)). I have also built a dating app based on speed dating, a [social workout app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pushups-master/id1344312940) and an app to [easily keep in touch with your friends](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coucou/id1506143712).

Iâ€™d like my focus to continue to be iOS because itâ€™s my passion, but I can help on the backend if needed as I started my career as a full stack engineer. I would also `LOVE` to get exposure to other parts of the business, like entrepreneurship, design, fundraising, and [continue to mentor](https://lifegorithms.com/hackathons-mentor/).

I listen to your Townhall every Sunday, which gives me a good feeling about your team and makes me want to work with you!

I also see so many things to work on, all super exciting: providing `analytics to moderators` (Iâ€™m a real data nerd), `accessibility` (solution for those hard of hearing), and the overall `scale of the product`!

Would love to take 15 minutes of your time to chat more!
Looking forward to hearing from you ðŸ¥³
