spoiler: Why would I have a website, in 2020?

I had a few (very random & useless) websites/blogs in my life.

It all started with [Skyblog](https://www.skyrock.com/blog/) when I was like 12, but unfortunately I might have deleted it a few years ago when I realized what kind of content I was posting. ðŸ˜‚ Now I do regret having deleted it...    
But I can tell you it was random stuff, from ideas to describing an afternoon spent with friends.

After that, I learned HTML/CSS, built a few websites kinda useless.    
At 18, when I started to look for (summer) jobs, I built a website on [papailhau.fr](https://papailhau.fr) (I stopped paying for it) and used it as a portfolio, let's call it "Early LinkedIn". ðŸ˜‡

I have a folder on my Google Driver called **Projets** (yes, in French), with almost all the projects I did in my life.  
I usually start by writing why I want to do this project, do some analysis, then write some specs to see what it would look like, then I build (or not...) and never touch this document again.  
I use this Google Drive folder to write down future ideas, but also to keep memories of my projects.

Already, we can discern **3 categories**: Article, Project and Job.  
So I will be splitting my content within these 3 categories:

### Article

Article would be anything and everything.  
Honestly, this is the part of this website I am the less sure about.  
Maybe I will end up writing only 1 article (this one), maybe more, let's see how it goes. I have a few ideas.

### Project

I want to document all the recent projects I made, mainly websites and Mobile applications.  
I have a very bad memory for some things, so this would be the perfect place to describe the project while it's still fresh in my mind, and then later I can come back to it and rediscover my projects I made a few years ago! ðŸ¥³

### Job

So far, I've lived my jobs as projects, I like what I do, I have fun doing it, so it could almost be in **Project**, but I will still keep this section as **Job** so that I can separate side projects/personal projects and professional life.  
In this section, I want to describe where I worked, what I learned, what I liked etc.

Maybe you realized that I am not at all talking about the name of this website, **Lifegorithms**, I'm sure it will come later, maybe in the **Article** section! ðŸ™ƒ
