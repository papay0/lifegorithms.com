This article contains two parts, the first one `describing the key moments of 2020` (it also serves as memories), months after months, and the second one being a `reflection of the year`.

2020 was my first full year living San Francisco, as I arrived in September 2019.

# Key moments

## January

I was in France for the first two weeks, visiting Paris and Bandol.

I was in San Francisco for the last two weeks, in my studio in Dolores.

I went skiing in Tahoe, it was my first time there. This place is beautiful!

## February

Moved with a roommate in Mission Bay, worst decision of the year, it was a disaster. She was behaving like a monster.

Rented a motorcycle with my friend Marta and drove to Napa.

I went to Angel Island with friends. Might have been the last social interaction without freaking out about Covid, February 22nd.

## March/April/May/June

- Pretty bad months, living hell with my roommate.
- Started to work remotely.
- Uber (my current company) was doing lots of layoff, I was extremely stressed because of my VISA situation. If I was laid off Iâ€™d need to leave the country.
- I was going on daily walks around Mission Bay, I was taking my (non-computer-required) meetings from a bench facing the water.

I was introduced to a Messenger Zoom Workout group, this saved my year. People leading the workouts were amazing, great human being, it gave me a sensation of belonging to a community, much needed during Covid.

Did my birthday with Family & Friends over zoom.

## July

I couldnâ€™t handle the roommate situation anymore, I found someone else to take over my lease, did a few weeks of Airbnb in San Francisco.

I rented a bike for 4th of July and went from Mission Bay to Sausalito, and back: ~ 38km.

## August

Flew to France, reunited with the family.
Lilou, one of my two cats, died a few days after I landed. Very sad moment. ðŸ˜­

Even with Covid, my step sister decided to not cancel her wedding.
My sister & I originally didnâ€™t want to go *because* it was too dangerous, but this decision started a family drama. So we ended up going.

Around eng of July/August, I started to learn about Options Trading. Very risky but also very interesting. Trading in France almost doesnâ€™t exist, people donâ€™t really invest in stocks.  
Or maybe I was just too young as a student to realize.  
Since I arrived in the US, I learned so much about 401k, different types of investments etc.

Wrote this article to summarize my knowledge and share with people new to the country: [What I wish someone would have told me about money management ðŸ’¸](https://lifegorithms.com/money-management-learnings/)


## September

Covid test negative: with a few friends we went at the beach for a few days to ~ Seignosse, France.

Still negative Covid test: I spent a few days in Amsterdam.

My second cat Speerou died, he was like my brother, 18 years old. It was very very very hard.

Me being sad every time I was leaving Bandol: (family town)

## October

I wanted to go back to the US, but there was a travel ban. So I needed to spend 14 days in Mexico because European couldnâ€™t go directly to the US.

I first flew to Frankfurt, Germany for a 20 hours layover.

Then flew to Cancun, Mexico.
I was in a nice hotel. The issue was (1) always eating the same food for 14 days is not ideal

But more importantly (2) a hurricane, named Delta, hit me and the hotel I was staying.  
I was evacuated to a shelter for two days, it was not a nice experience.  
I was sleeping on the floor in a room full of people, it was looking like dead people.

The morning after the hurricane:

After a few more days spent in another place, I finally came back to the main hotel for a few days, then flew to San Francisco where I stayed for 3 weeks.

First dinner, best dinner, In-N-Out!

The plan was to go to LA, but then it changed to NYC, but it got canceled because of Covid so I ended up choosing Hawaii and went with my friend Zach.

## November

Hawaii was AMAZING. Highly recommend!  
I started surfing, almost everyday, best thing that happened in 2020 for sure!

Almost everyday, I was going to the beach to watch the sunset.
My level of happiness around the beach and surfing was very high!!
I hiked, rented a scooter, did my first skydiving jump, so beautiful! ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLpYZO9cDU))

## December

After spending a full month in Hawaii, I came back to SF for a few days then flew to Amsterdam to see my friends.

![Amsterdam December](./amsterdam-december.png)

I then took a train to Bandol, France.  
I surprised my mother by coming a few days earlier, then surprised my sister for her birthday!

![Bandol December](./bandol-december.png)

I spent Christmas ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmcsTjK6f0g)) and NYE with the family.

During all this time traveling, from end of September to mid-December, I was staying in hotels.
Hotel life has some advantages, itâ€™s clean, but food was an issue.  
I do love ordering from UberEats and eating burgers all the time, but twice a day, burger, pizza and burrito, itâ€™s too much.

Finally, I met with a friend to do a song video summarizing our past 5 years. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK3GOF3CS9Y))

![Pano 2020](./pano-2020.png)

My trading year went well (+71%) but I did lots of mistakes, I learned a lot and Iâ€™ll definitely learn more in 2021 and hopefully not do the same mistakes again.  
I will focus on risk management and I will cut losses earlier.

During all this time traveling, I was working remotely. It was not an issue. I am used to work late anyway so the time different was not an issue.
